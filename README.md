### Startup and Shutdown
sudo service watchcat start | stop | status | restart
 

####Deployment Script:
The deploy script can be used to update all instances of watchcat on remote servers. It mostly works but it does have some kinks to still be worked out.
It lives in the deployment dir and is called wc_deploy.rb.

This takes a list of hosts and runs remote ssh commands on the specific server to call the watchcat_update.sh script. Which is just like the install shell script but trimmed down to only handle the update parts.

All servers that get watchcat installed get a watchcat user and this is how the remote commands are run for the deployment script. 

Currently it is not tied to git pushes or anything via webhooks, but it easily could be. Right now its still being manually run on the tools server /var/www/tools/deploy
